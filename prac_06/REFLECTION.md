# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

...The process hasn’t changed much, but I’m not going to separate out a whole process like I did last semester.
The consistency of writing code is very important to me this semester. Incoherent work will confuse my thinking.
## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

...I think I am not familiar enough with the code, and PyCharm's automatic code generation is too easy to use. 
I need to change this bad habit.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

...I don't know either. I decided that I was lacking in every aspect.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

...I always forget to watch the lectures before class. This must change.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

...No suggestions, I think the teacher level and teaching quality are all excellent.
