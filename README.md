Welcome to the Practical Projects repository! This repository contains various practical exercises and projects that have been developed as part of my coursework. It serves as a showcase of my work and learning throughout the course.

## About Me

My name is Wentao Dong, I am a student working on practical exercises and projects in the field of software development. My goal is to improve my coding skills and apply best practices learned throughout the course.

## Lessons Learned about Clean Code

- Writing code that is clear and straightforward helps others (and yourself) understand the code more easily. Simple and concise code is easier to maintain and less prone to bugs.
- Using descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes enhances the readability of the code. Good names help convey the purpose and use of various code elements.
-  Breaking down code into smaller, reusable functions and avoiding code duplication makes it easier to maintain and test. This practice aligns with the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, promoting efficient and organized code.
